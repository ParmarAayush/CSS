Day 1 : 
    [ using % avoid to set Height ]
        - set * means all element apply box-sizing: border-box;
        - in the example code we use Height becaus we don't have content 

    [ % on the child ]
        - don't set height to childe element 
        - dont't set width but it's required in some situation
    
    [ why it's good idea to avoid height ]
        - if required more space use padding ( set to paretn element ? )
        - suggest to use em unit rather then %

    [ Challenge 01 ]
        - aloways use margin after width if set


Day 2 : Getting familiar with relative unit 
    [ relative unit ]
        - em take font-size from parent element font size
        - em use for any other properties(padding, margin)
          measure size based on self font-size (adaptive nature)
        - use-full for buttons  

        - rem is truely based on html not body

    [ Why you shouldn't set font-sizes using em ]
        - for margin and padding use em beacuse its shrink with that element font size 
        - for font size use rem whcih depends upon html not body
        
Day 3 : Max-width   
    [ Challenge 1 solution ]

    [ adding in a max-width ]
        - after some limtes of width website makes awkward experience 
        - some time site create side scrolling if we drop below that width 
          solution is to always set width in % 
        
        - when we set max-width its stop growing afte some set point so its give equally prview in large screen device 
          and prevent streching from one side 
        - ( is important to set max-width after width ? )
    
    [ Challenge 02 ]

Day 4 : Extra curricular Activity
    [ CSS unit : vh, vw vmin, vmax ]
        - vh stands for viewport height but its create problem with smaller device 
          content oveflow so fix it using media query 
          
        - vw stands for viewport width same its take width equal to viewport
        - vw, vh is greater than %, percentage shrink with parent element

Day 5 : 
    [ font-face - self study ]
    [ source : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK-yy6C2Nck&ab_channel=KevinPowell ]
    
        - download file in ttf formate and extract into assets/fonts
        - after extract file use "https://www.fontsquirrel.com/tools/webfont-generator"
          for decrease file size and other customization
        - download and use 

Day 6 :
    - em is usefull for buttons because we set font-size of button
      em changes based on font-size(in rem) of that elements 

    - set height width using padding along with em units now when 
      bigger or smaller screen then change font size and button automatically shrink with it
