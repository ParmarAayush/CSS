Day 1 : 
    [ using % avoid to set Height ]
        - set * means all element apply box-sizing: border-box;
        - in the example code we use Height becaus we don't have content 

    [% on the child ]
        - don't set height to childe element 
        - dont't set width but it's required in some situation
    
    [ why it's good idea to avoid height ]
        - if required more space use padding ( set to paretn element ? )
        - suggest to use em unit rather then %

    [ Challenge 01 ]
        - aloways use margin after width if set


Day 2 : Getting familiar with relative unit 
    [ relative unit ]
        - em take font-size from parent element font size
        - em use for any other properties(padding, margin)
          measure size based on self font-size (adaptive nature)
        - use-full for buttons  

        - rem is truely based on html not body

    [ Why you shouldn't set font-sizes using em ]
        - for margin and padding use em beacuse its shrink with that element font size 
        - for font size use rem whcih depends upon html not body
