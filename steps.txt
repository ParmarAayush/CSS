Day 1 : 
    [ using % avoid to set Height ]
        - set * means all element apply box-sizing: border-box;
        - in the example code we use Height becaus we don't have content 

    [% on the child ]
        - don't set height to childe element 
        - dont't set width but it's required in some situation
    
    [ why it's good idea to avoid height ]
        - if required more space use padding ( set to paretn element ? )
        - suggest to use em unit rather then %

    [ Challenge 01 ]
        - aloways use margin after width if set
